SYSTEM SUMMARY:


Project name: project and thesis management portal
#todo: check grammar and spelling later
Summary:


Projects and Thesis are two of the most important activities of a university. It not only helps the students to get a broader vision in a particular field which they are studying, but also the repuation of the university depend on it. 
This system intends to keep an organaized record of the thesises and projects of an university which can be helpful in many different ways including:
* Analysis on what type of projects or thesises are done in a particular university
* In what field a student or faculty has done more research or project
* What projects or thesises went to a competition from an university
* A freshman can have a broader vision on which field to pursue and from whom to take advise on this pursuit.
